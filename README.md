`monthly-summary` is a small side-project I created to experiment with NextJS and TypeScript. It is currently being used to showcase a monthly summary of my team completed tasks at work and provide visibility to my team members.

```bash

Then, run the development server:

```bash

To create a new summary, you need to create a yaml file into ./resources/ you can take example of the other file.

If you create a file `jambon.yml`, you will be able to find your summary in: `localhost:3000/monthly/jambon`
